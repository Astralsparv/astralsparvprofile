Shopping Cart had a great day today, we had stolen a little gremlin’s lanyard and constructed a harness for him so that he doesn’t have to live in my bag when he doesn’t have his designated seat.

Finally having a break from exams, Shopping Cart was able to be comfy in his harness all day (surprisingly no teachers mentioned him even though he was so very visible) and had his designated seat within Computer Science and English.

In English, there was only a third of the class so it was SO quiet, he got to sit at the front in the fancy comfy cushioned spinny seat and stare at everyone in disgust like the autistic gremlin he is <3

Instead of having to sit in my bag on the route home, Shopping Cart was able to sit in the harness alongside Twig (he lives on my lanyard) and got to experience the bus life safely without fret of THIEVING FIENDS ✨

He’s currently being the sleepy eepy in his alien bed and says goodnight to you all.
