Shopping Cart got to experience a full day in his harness, excluding the mean chemistry exam and when he got his designated seat in Computer Science.
Using an old lanyard, a school lanyard (very crudely drawn) was created for him and tied 2 million times just to fit him and it still falls down to his feet. Stubby alien…. He has finally been forced to pick a surname because of "human things", disgusting. He has taken the name Shopping-Cart Sparrow as Aftonsparv is Evening Sparrow, but may end up referred to with Vespere-Passer (Evening Sparrow in Latin).

He fears the big mean physics teacher with the harness as he had screamed at us for having him out previously - he prays that he shall be safe from his evil old man wrath. He had survived the big mean physics teacher, again, he went unnoticed on the harness somehow.

He was able to see the amazing race car coding with the Kitronic Buggy in our class, making an amazing robot driving thing that automatically pathfinds except it doesn’t like to work. Shopping Cart glared at it with great hatred.

Shopping Cart is officially welcomed as a student at our school, with our principal accepting him as a student, it was amazing, this school is literally so autistic.
Shopping Cart looks forward to tomorrow's freedom after school.
