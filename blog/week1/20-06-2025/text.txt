Shopping Cart met our head of year - our head of year said this is so (my school)* of me to have Shopping Cart with his lanyard and harness.
* our school is split into two schools, one with a focus on creatives and one with a focus on sciences.

Later in the day, he had seen my recreation of our school lanyard to the same width and height that I was going to print and laminate for the next week and said that this masterpiece is "too much", I'm so very upset. This is a DISGRACE. His pencil drawn ID is NOT ENOUGH. Shopping cart wanted to cry.

He took some pictures at lunch and he looks fabulous, even took one with Twig, he looks forwards to Graphics as everyone hates it and he watches us suffer whilst he has his own seat. He looks forward to sleeping like a rock today, it's Friday and he is FREE.

On the way home, Shopping cart was approached by a drunk guy and complimented - he was in fear - t’was very interesting. He remained safe and the drunk guy was respectful !
Shopping cart has came home and has immediately slept all day whilst I have SLAVED repairing and refurbishing a Win 7 PC (if you guys want me to post a blog on this I will I’ve took like a HP Business PC I got on gumtree for free and started repairs and upgrading it).

He is still the sleepy eepy and wishes you all a good sleepy eepy.

Goodnight!
