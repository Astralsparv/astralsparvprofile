Shopping cart had laid in bed most of the day, though has checked out a few different alternatives (boxes) for when his bed has pillows and blankets sewn.
He became part of the aforementioned Windows 7 PC and it is now officially an alienware PC (he is no longer allowed in the pc - he ate the cpu).

He has had a very lazy day but now sits cuddling with me at the time of writing this segment.

Shopping cart has been LAZY and SLEPT since then with Twig and Silver (the lil dog) and he wishes you the goodnight.

Sleep well alien lovers
